Template that guides you through building a command line application which has the functionality to parse  CLI arguments 
and read keyboard inputs from the terminal in Go.

## Steb by Step Guide to: Building a CLI app that parses CLI arguments and reads keyboard inputs from the terminal in Go

1. - [ ] Briefly summaries how the apps supposed to work and put in **summary** of README.md - This will be updated as 
      functionality and implementation are refined:
      
      - User compiles and runs executable from command-line parsing **valid argument(s)**
      - User is then prompted to enter **input value**
      - Then the app prints out **desired outcome**
      
      **Example:**
      - User compiles and runs executable from command-line parsing **the unit of temperature we want to convert from** 
      - User is then prompted to enter **input value**
      - Then the app prints out **converted temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius**.
